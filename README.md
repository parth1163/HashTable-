Popular Course Combinations: A Java Solution
This project provides a Java-based solution for the "Popular Course Combinations" problem. The program calculates the number of distinct pairs of students who share at least one course. It is designed to be efficient and uses specific data structures as required by the assignment constraints.


Features
Efficiently counts popular student pairs from a list of enrollments.

Handles varying numbers of students and courses, with a maximum of 100 students.

Utilizes advanced data structures (HashMap and HashSet) for optimal performance.
